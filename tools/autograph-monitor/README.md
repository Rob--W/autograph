Autograph Monitor
=================

A small tool that queries Autograph's monitoring endpoint `__monitor__` and
verifies each signature returned to make sure the service is operating
correctly.

Monitor runs standalone or as a lambda function.

Three environment variables are required:

* AUTOGRAPH_URL is the address of the autograph endpoint
* AUTOGRAPH_KEY is the monitoring API key
* AUTOGRAPH_ENV optionally sets the root of the firefox pki to a pre-defined value
    depending on the environment monitor is running in.
    Acceptable values are "stage" and "prod".
    When unset, this will use a default value for local development.

With these env vars set, running monitor is as easy as:

```bash
AUTOGRAPH_URL=http://localhost:8000/ \
AUTOGRAPH_KEY=19zd4w3xirb5syjgdx8atq6g91m03bdsmzjifs2oddivswlu9qs \
./autograph-monitor

The additional environmental variable `AUTOGRAPH_ROOT_HASH` sets the
root hash monitor will use to verify addon and content signature (as
used in `run-monitor-with-root-hash.sh`).
